# SWA

This repository contains a [Joomla component](https://docs.joomla.org/Component) that contains most of the logic for the [Student Windsurfing Association website](https://www.studentwindsurfing.co.uk/).

And a [Joomla Plugin](https://docs.joomla.org/Plugin) adding some custom behavior for [view levels](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Access_Control_List_Tutorial) based on data provided by the SWA component. The plugin uses `onJAccessGetAuthorisedViewLevels`, a custom event that needs to be added to Joomla code.
